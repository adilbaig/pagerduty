PHP PagerDuty Events API
=========
PHP implementation of the [PagerDuty Events API V2](https://v2.developer.pagerduty.com/docs/events-api-v2)


UPGRADE NOTICE
---
The [Events API V2](https://v2.developer.pagerduty.com/docs/events-api-v2) is **not backwards compatible** with the [Events API V1](https://v2.developer.pagerduty.com/docs/events-api). Hence, this API has changed. If you are upgrading from a [2.* release](https://github.com/adilbaig/pagerduty/releases), make sure you pay attention to the contructor of the `TriggerEvent`

[![Latest Stable Version](https://poser.pugx.org/adilbaig/pagerduty/v/stable.svg)](https://packagist.org/packages/adilbaig/pagerduty) [![Total Downloads](https://poser.pugx.org/adilbaig/pagerduty/downloads.svg)](https://packagist.org/packages/adilbaig/pagerduty) 

Features
---

- Compatible with [PD Events API V2](https://v2.developer.pagerduty.com/v2/docs/#the-events-api).

Usage
---

Trigger an event
 
````php
use \PagerDuty\TriggerEvent;
use \PagerDuty\PagerDutyException;

$routingKey = "1d334a4819fc4b67a795b1c54f9a"; //Replace this with the integration key of your service.

// In this example, we're triggering a "Service is down" message from a web server.
try {
    $event = new TriggerEvent($routingKey, "Service is down", "web-server-01", TriggerEvent::ERROR, true);
    $responseCode = $event->send();
    if($responseCode == 200)
        echo "Success";
    elseif($responseCode == 429)
        echo "Rate Limited";  //You're being throttled. Slow down.
    else // An error occured. Try again later
        echo "Some error has occured. Try again later";
} catch(PagerDutyException $exception) { //This doesn't happen unless you've broken their guidelines. The API tries to minimize user mistakes
    var_dump($exception->getErrors());
}

````

Automatically send only one PagerDuty incident for repeated errors

````php

//You will only see one incident on PD
(TriggerEvent($routingKey, "Service is down", "web-server-01", TriggerEvent::ERROR, true))->send();
(TriggerEvent($routingKey, "Service is down", "web-server-01", TriggerEvent::ERROR, true))->send();
(TriggerEvent($routingKey, "Service is down", "web-server-01", TriggerEvent::ERROR, true))->send();

````

Create a detailed 'trigger' event, add optional data. Dump the event and inspect response from PD

````php
use \PagerDuty\TriggerEvent;
use \PagerDuty\Context\LinkContext;
use \PagerDuty\Context\ImageContext;

//Taken from the `trigger` example @ https://v2.developer.pagerduty.com/docs/send-an-event-events-api-v2
//Send a detailed event, and store the `dedup_key` generated on the server

$event = new TriggerEvent(
    $routingKey, 
    "Example alert on host1.example.com", 
    "monitoringtool:cloudvendor:central-region-dc-01:852559987:cluster/api-stats-prod-003", 
    TriggerEvent::INFO
);
$event
    ->setPayloadTimestamp("2015-07-17T08:42:58.315+0000")
    ->setPayloadComponent("postgres")
    ->setPayloadGroup("prod-datapipe")
    ->setPayloadClass("deploy")
    ->setPayloadCustomDetails(["ping_time" => "1500ms", "load_avg" => 0.75])
    ->addContext(new LinkContext("https://example.com/", "Link text"))
    ->addContext(new ImageContext("https://www.pagerduty.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/pagerduty-logo-green.png", "https://example.com/", "Example text"))
;

// Pass in the '$response' variable by reference if you want to inspect PD's response. This is optional, and you probably don't need this in production.
$response = null;
$responseCode = $event->send($response);
// In this case, we will save the `dedup_key` generated by the PD server
var_dump($response['dedup_key']);
````

Acknowledge an event
----

````php
(new AcknowledgeEvent($routingKey, "dedup key"))->send();
````

Resolve an event
----
````php
(new ResolveEvent($routingKey, "dedup key"))->send();
````

**A.** In your PagerDuty console, click 'Configuration' > 'Services'. Click the link under 'Integrations' column. It's the 'Integration Key'
